* allow cmdstanr as new backend for blrm_exnex. The Stan model file is
  written with the function cmdstanr::write_stan_file to disk such
  that the model binaries can be cached if the user defines the global
  option cmdstanr_write_stan_file_dir. See ?cmdstanr::write_stan_file
  (requires cmdstanr >= 0.5.0)

February 28th, 2022 (0.8-5)

* fix issue with example_model not exposing properly objects when
  running with silent=TRUE

February 18th, 2022 (0.8-4)

* Switch SBC runs to use clustermq in lieu of batchtools. Also now use
  L'Ecuyer CMG as rng engine during SBC runs.

* add critical_quantile function allowing to calculate critical doses
  which fulfill conditions like EWOC.

October 7th, 2021 (0.8-3)

* Make Stan model compile with 2.27+ (lupmf postfix for variables is
  not allowed)

September 13th, 2021 (0.8-2)

* Drop unneccessary random variables from the posterior whenever
  save_warmup=FALSE. This decreases the size of the posterior in
  memory by ~60% for the combo2 example.

September 1st, 2021 (0.8-1)

* Address CRAN comments

August 31st, 2021 (0.8-0)

* Significantly speedup Stan model by dropping normalization of binomial
* The default interaction model for blrm_trial is now saturating
  (blrm_formula_saturating) in logit space, improving behavior for combinations 
  with antagonistic toxicity.
* blrm_trial simplified prior now defaults to ENXEX off, and prior parameter
  defaults have been updated.
* New save_warmup argument to blrm_exnex can be used to disable saving of warmup
  samples, which defaults to the OncoBayes2.MC.save_warmup option, which 
  defaults to TRUE in line with previous versions.
  NOTE: Starting with the next version 0.9.0 the new default will be FALSE!
* Do not crash for summary(trial, "data_prediction") if blrm_trial has NULL or 
  0-row data
* Spurious warning for dose_id NA on blrm_trial instantiation removed
* Spurious warning for dose not prespecified on summary(..., newdata=...)
  removed
* New plot function plot_toxicity_intervals_stacked(), which visualizes model
  posterior or predictive probabilities in discrete intervals, over a continuous
  range of doses
* Automated visual regression testing implemented using the vdiffr package
* Fix in plot_toxicity_curve to avoid overplotting if newdata contains columns
  other than grouping variables and doses (e.g. dose_id)
* Avoid re-parsing model formula whenever newdata is not used in
  respective functions. This prevents that changes to global variables
  (like dref) have any effect whenever the fitted data only is used.

May 7th, 2021 (0.7-0)

* Catch data specification errors for wrongly nested groups/strata
* BLRM trials now also print toxicity probability intervals and the EWOC setting
* The blrm_formula_linear and blrm_formula_saturating interaction model formula 
  generators can now be customized to generate specific interactions using the
  specific_interaction_terms argument.
* Add predictive summaries to summary method.
* Switch predictive outputs to be based on averaging sampling density. This avoids
  the need for additional sampling for predictive summaries.
* Add plotting methods for blrmfit and blrm_trial objects.

May 7th, 2020 (0.6-5)

* Drop RBesT dependency
* Avoid setting the ggplot2 theme upon package load
* Enhance SBC runs to monitor and report sampler diagnostics

April 7th, 2020 (0.6-4)

* Add Operation Qualification script (run-oq.R in inst/extra)
* Add saturating interaction model (blrm_formula_saturating) and associated tests

March 18th, 2020 (0.6-3)

* 2nd attempt to work around issues found by clang sanitizer in Stan model.

March 9th, 2020 (0.6-2)

* Work around issues found by clang sanitizer in Stan model.

March 4th, 2020 (0.6-1)

* Fix issue with upcoming R 4.0 which changes stringsAsFactors default
  to FALSE
* Fix for upcoming tibble 3.0 upgrade which changes conventions of
  growing factors within tibbles

February 11th, 2020 (0.6-0)

* Fix issue with model outputs when EXNEX is being used. We recommend
  all users to upgrade to this version. The SBC runs now include
  checks for the per-group estimates to avoid a regression of the bug.
* Correct printing of prior information wrt. to summaries of number of
  strata and groups.

December 12th, 2019 (0.5-8)

* Merge data with same group and dosing in blrm_trial before passing
  into blrm_exnex for improved performance
* Ensure consistent sorting of this data to improve reproducibility of
  output with respect to input data permutations
* speedup Stan model which now skips data rows with no cases
* correct blrm_exnex documentation to reflect correctly exchangability
  model used for the interaction model

December 9th, 2019 (0.5-7)

* Improve numerical stability of log_inv_logit function, preventing
  NaNs in the output of pp_data and resulting errors in summary()

November 29th, 2019 (0.5-6)

* Support summary.blrm_trial(...) syntax passing into summary.blrmfit()

November 22nd, 2019 (0.5-5)

* Fixed Roxygen for posterior_predict

November 18th, 2019 (0.5-4)

  model objects of class blrmfit or blrm_trial
* various smaller bug fixes

August 28th, 2019 (0.4-4)

* run in all examples the example code (remove dontrun sections)

August 27th, 2019 (0.4-3)

* use message instead of cat in functions using printing except
  summary or print
* suppress by default messages from Stan, can be enable with
  verbose=TRUE
* make examples run with very short sampling

August 27th, 2019 (0.4-2)

* Correct loading and exporting of methods
